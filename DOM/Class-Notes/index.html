<!-- CLASS NOTES WEEK 5

The DOM is the website and we use the console to 
inspect that site

You can use the console (within inspect) to manipulate
a website.

You can use the DOM to give you website dynamic action

Note from AJ in chat "important note - 
in the console we're still working with 
JavaScript objects: document, Node, NodeList, etc

minimal (a shell) and javascript is used to 
manipulate the DOM to create things on the fly"

the HTML when put together is what gives us the DOM

The DOM is what you are interacting with on a web site

THe browser creates the DOM
