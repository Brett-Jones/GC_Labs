<!-- CLASS NOTES WEEK 5

The DOM is the website and we use the console to 
inspect that site

You can use the console (within inspect) to manipulate
a website.

You can use the DOM to give you website dynamic action

Note from AJ in chat "important note - 
in the console we're still working with 
JavaScript objects: document, Node, NodeList, etc

minimal (a shell) and javascript is used to 
manipulate the DOM to create things on the fly"
